    <p>One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over their winter fire in the little
        French town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney.</p>

    <p>Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing
        thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery.</p>
    <p>Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising
        smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.”</p>
